CS4760  : Project 2

HOW TO RUN
----------
1. Run the make command to create master and slave executables.
2. Type ./master -t ss n   OR    ./master n
3. Type slave xx (between 1 and 20) to run child process.
4. If no time is specified, it will default to 100 seconds. 
5. If n is greater than 20, the program will set n to 20 and still run. 
6. After forceful exit or time running out, type -ls to see results. 
7. After running once, run clean command for best results.


COMMANDS & PAIRINGS
-------------------
./master n -> slave xx                (Time will default to 100 seconds and allow you to enter xx between 1 and 20.           
./master -t ss n -> slave xx          (Allows you to set time in seconds and enter xx between 1 and 20.


Version Control
---------------
The .git subdirectory can be found by running ls -la in the directory.

ISSUES/CHANGES
--------------
After running ./master n or ./master -t ss n, the user is supposed to enter slave xx. I'm not fully sure if
we were supposed include this process in the master file itself, but I interpreted it as allowing the user
to run the logical process number through input. If nothing is entered after the inital ./master usage, then it will
exit and print that to logfile.master. The user can then go into logfile.xx. It should work the same anyways.

Also was not fully sure about the logfile.master format, so I ended up using the same format when I was testing out the time library.
